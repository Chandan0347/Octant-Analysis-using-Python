# Octant-Analysis-using-Python

This repository contains code that analyses the octant data extracted from transient fluctuating velocity components at one/several point(s) in a flow.
This project is series of tasks involved in Octant Analysis.

Tasks:
1. Counting octants
2. Counting transitions involved in data of octants.
3. Longest subsequence count
4. Counting of above points, along with range
